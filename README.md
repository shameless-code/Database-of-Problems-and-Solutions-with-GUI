## Goal of the project
It is a simple project to showcase my basic skills in using sqlite3 for creating databases and creating GUI with Tkinter.
## What the project does
This program allows you to store solutions and descriptions of problems.
It can:
1. Create databases
2. Loads data from databases (and verify if the database is suitable for this program) 
3. Browse databases
4. Provide windows for ADD, UPDATE, DELETE operations.
## Not implemented feature
There are no other languages than English implemented. Currently the option for switching GUI language does nothing.
## Extra files
The code has two previously created databases for testing purposes:
1. "Test database.db" - Is the valid test database
2. "Not a database.db" - Is the invalid test database to show that program will not load a database that does not fulfill requirements
## Requirements
The script is compatible with Python 3 and does not require any additional libraries.
